To do:




*SPEED
Remove so many images from loading in tilelayer
Use Cullrect on deckgl?
use iconatlas on main layer merge images in sharp

*IMAGE QUALITY
- figure out the pixel size of low-res images and use that size rather than the 1000x1000
- higher-res image finder (use image size from different services, or pixelate calculate)

TILELAYER
* CACHING AND ALL THE TILE GENERATION TOOLS THAT COME IN TILELAYER FOR **TILES** BUT IM NOT USING

*LIKE
*COMMENT
- encode icons INTO the full-res iamge.
